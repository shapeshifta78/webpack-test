# webpack-test
Playing around with webpack

Goal was to see how webpack can handle multiple css files. 
Result: Because it is javascript centric it always creates a js file for every entry, even though I just provide a css file. :\

Another thing I wanted to test was how to use sass and post-css as a loader.
